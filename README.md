# Lift

A simple, minimal workout tracker that runs as a PWA. Manage your workout routines through a built-in CMS, track exercises with configurable sets/reps, and use rest timers — all from your phone or desktop.

## Features

- **Progressive Web App** — install on your phone, works offline
- **Built-in CMS** — manage workout days, exercises, and bookend routines (warmup/cooldown) via Decap CMS
- **Rest Timer** — configurable rest duration with sound notification
- **Customizable Defaults** — set default reps, sets, and rest duration in preferences

## Use This Template

1. Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub to create your own repo
2. Deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (or any static host)
3. Open the app and go to **Manage Workouts** to create your workout days and exercises via the CMS

## Staying Updated

This template includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/sync-template.yml`) that automatically syncs updates from the upstream template.

- Runs weekly (every Sunday) and can also be triggered manually
- Opens a **pull request** with the changes so you can review before merging
- Your personal workout data in `content/` won't conflict since the template doesn't include those files

To trigger a sync manually: go to **Actions** → **Sync from Template** → **Run workflow**.
